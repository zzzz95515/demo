/**
 * Enumeration of phase identifiers. Allows designation of phases for both 
 * transmission and distribution equipment, circuits and loads.Residential 
 * and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase, or split-phase, 
 * secondary circuits. For example of s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer to hot wires 
 * that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral wire. 
 * Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits 
 * may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase 
 * loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.
