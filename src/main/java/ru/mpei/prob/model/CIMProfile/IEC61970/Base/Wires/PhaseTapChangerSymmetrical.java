/**
 * Describes a symmetrical phase shifting transformer tap model in which the 
 * secondary side voltage magnitude is the same as at the primary side. The 
 * difference voltage magnitude is the base in an equal-sided triangle where 
 * the sides corresponds to the primary and secondary voltages. The phase 
 * angle difference corresponds to the top angle and can be expressed as twice 
 * the arctangent of half the total difference voltage.
